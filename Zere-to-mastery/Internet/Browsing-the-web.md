<p>
  I see a lot of people just skimming the surface of this stuff without fully
  understanding how everything works together.

<p>what is browsing the web?</p>

laptop - browser(google chrome) <br />
When you are giving orders to google (browser) <br />

BROWSER - ISP - DNS Browser -> (Question in Google : who is this google.com
fellow?) <br />
ISP -> DNS (I don't know him personally, but here is his address) <br />
But here IP ADDRESS is: 172.217.7.23 it knows
