      Solution (1)
      heading + script(js)

        When the browser is parsing the HTML and sees script tags, 
        it stops parsing and then starts downloading the JS files.
        and then executing the JS files and then starts parsing HTML again.
 

        Why? ->
        what if the website is massive and the internet is slow? 
        it will take forever to see the page so this is not a good option

      Solution (2)
      body + script(js)

       When HTML is done being parsed, it starts fetching JS files and then executing the files.


       Why? ->
       When HTML is done being parsed, the page is ready for USERS which is good.
       However, 
       What if the website is full of JS files? it will take for a long time to download JS files and then excute them.


      Solution (3)
      head + async 

      async -> boolean type(true)

      When the browser is parsing the HTML and sees the "async", 
      it downloads the JS files and then starts parsing HTML.
      And when the files are downloaded, 
      the browser is executing the JS files and then starts parsing the rest of HTML again.


        Why? -> 
        It will download the JS files faster.
        However, 
        JS files are being executed as soon as they are donwloaded and even before all the HTML elements are parsed.
        So the JS files will NOT be able to read the other HTML elements.
        Also, JS files will be executed from time to time so it might take longer for the page to be loaded.


      Solution (4)
      head + defer

      when the browser is parsing HTML and sees "defer", 
      it just tells the tags to download the files first.
      And when it's done parsing HTML, it starts executing the JS files.

  
      Why? ->
      USERS will see the page first and then the browser will execute JS right away
      because JS files are already downloaded.
