    <h3>removing Nodes with remove()</h3>
    <div id="result">
      <h2>remove(new function) - removeChild</h2>
      <h3>removeChild requires a parent</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      The node is not actually removed <br />
      The confusion might be because you might think removing an element means
      something like killing or destroying it. <br />
      But in fact, the concept of removal basically means breaking the
      relationship between a child and its parent. It's just a detachment.
      <p />
    </p>
    <p> <b> Element1(parent) > Element2(child)</b> <br>
     => <strong>Element1 - Element2</strong> 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Shouldn't I get an error while trying to insert an element which does not
      exist? => No, because it still exists.
    </p>
    <p>
      How is remove different from removeChild? <br />
      => remove only needs a reference to the child. removeChild needs a
      reference both to the parent and the child. The result is identical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there any way to ensure that element is actually removed from memory? <br>
      => No. You can only unreference it and hope that there is a garbage collector which will detect the object is not referenced and then will remove it

      const result = document.querySelector("#result");
      const heading2 = result.querySelector("h2");
      const heading3 = result.querySelector("h3");
      console.log(heading3); //  <h3>removeChild</h3>
      result.removeChild(heading3);
